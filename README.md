# Extrasensory perception is real and we all have it, but don't realize because it works through emotions. People are very sensitive in light sleep, and also dream of things they cannot know. And this can be proven.

Therere is a connection between dreams and future events, which is supported by research such as this: https://doi.org/10.11588/ijodr.2023.1.89054. Most likely, the brain processes all available information during sleep and makes predictions.

I have long been fascinated by things like lucid dreaming and out-of-body experiences, and I also had a very vivid near-death experience as a child. As a result of analyzing my experiences over many years, I found a method for deciphering my dreams, which allowed me not only to detect correlations but also to predict certain specific events.

The method is based on the statistics of coincidences between various recurring dreams and events. Here is how it works. Most dreams convey information not literally, but through a personal language of associative symbols that transmit emotional experience.

For example, I have a long-established association, a phrase from an old movie: "A dog is a man's best friend." I dream of a dog, and a friend appears in my reality. The behavior or other characteristics of the dog in the dream are the same as those of that person in real life.

The exact time and circumstances remain unknown, but every time I have a dream with different variations of a recurring element, it is followed by an event corresponding to the symbolism of the dream and its emotional significance.

A rare exception is a literal prediction; you see almost everything in the dream as it will happen in reality or close to it. The accuracy of the vision directly depends on the emotional weight of the dream.

The more vivid, memorable, and lucid the dream, the more significant the event it conveys, and conversely, the more vague and surreal the dream, the more mundane the situations it predicts.

Another criterion is valence, an evaluation on a bad-good scale. Both of these criteria—emotional weight and valence—form dream patterns that are projected onto real-life events.

Thus, by tracking recurring dreams and events, and comparing them using qualitative patterns, it is possible to determine the meaning of dream symbols to subsequently decipher dreams and predict events in advance.

There is another very important point. I do not deny the mechanism of predictive processing of previously received information, but, based on personal experience, I cannot agree that it is exhaustive. It cannot explain the absolutely accurate observation of things or the experiencing of events that could not be derived from the available information, and which occurred years or even decades after they were predicted.

In neuroscience, interbrain synchrony is actively being studied, where the brain waves of different people can synchronize, for example, while playing online games, even if they are in different rooms far apart. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393222001750?via%3Dihub

In my experiences during the transition to an out-of-body state, as well as in ordinary life, I have repeatedly encountered a very pronounced reaction from people around me that correlated with my emotional state. At the same time, these people could be in another room, or even in another part of the city, and I was not externally expressing my state in any way. Most often, such a reaction was observed in people in a state of light sleep. I could practically control their reaction to some extent by changing my emotional state, and they tried to respond by talking in their sleep. Therefore, I believe that prophetic dreams are a prediction, but one based on a much larger amount of information, including extrasensory perception.

All my experience is published here (editorial / opinion Piece): https://doi.org/10.11588/ijodr.2024.1.102315, and is currently purely subjective and only indirectly confirmed by people reporting similar experiences.

Therefore, I had the idea to create an AI tool, an application, that can turn the subjective experience of many people into accurate scientific data and confirm the extrasensory predictive ability of dreams in situations where a forecast based on previously obtained data is insufficient.

The application would resemble a typical dream interpreter where dreams and real-life events would be entered by voice or text. The AI would track patterns and display statistics, gradually learning the user's individual dream language and increasing the accuracy of predictions.

However, the application will not make unequivocal predictions that could influence the user's decisions, but rather provide a tool for self-exploration, focusing on personal growth and spiritual development.

If desired, users will be able to participate in the dream study by anonymously sharing their statistics in an open database of predictive dream patterns, making contribution to the science of consciousness.

Open to cooperation.
