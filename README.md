# DreamCode-
A research project leveraging LLMs to decipher the personalized, symbolic language of dreams. We correlate recurring dream patterns (emotion, valence) with documented future events to validate the hypothesis of extrasensory predictive processing. Seeking collaborators to build an open-source tool for consciousness studies.
